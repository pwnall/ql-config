This is my configuration file for Quake Live. Pull requests are welcome!

* Row 1: Tab,   Q, W, E, R
* Row 2: Caps,  A, S, D, F
* Row 3: Shift, Z, X, C
* Thumb keys: Alt, Space
* Thumb d-pad: 9 directions

Right hand: Razer Tron mouse
* 2-buttons on the front
* Left side: button 3 (easy), button 4 (hard)
* Right side: sensitivity adjustment (hard)
* Crappy scroll wheel

Screen: large so I need to play in a window
